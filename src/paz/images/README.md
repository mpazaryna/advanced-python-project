# Images

This module provides asynchronous image processing capabilities for the PAZ (Python A to Z)
financial risk assessment pipeline. It includes functions for loading, processing, and saving
images, as well as applying various filters and transformations.

The primary use cases in financial risk assessment include:

1. Processing scanned financial documents for OCR and data extraction
2. Analyzing charts and graphs from financial reports
3. Verifying signatures and other visual elements in contracts or official documents

The module leverages asyncio for concurrent processing, allowing efficient handling of
multiple images simultaneously. This is particularly useful when dealing with large
batches of financial documents or when integrating image analysis into real-time
financial risk assessment workflows.

## Key Features

- Asynchronous image loading and saving
- Concurrent processing of multiple images
- Customizable processing pipeline with easy addition/removal of steps
- Progress tracking for long-running operations
- Error handling and logging for robust operation in production environments

## Dependencies

- asyncio: For managing asynchronous operations
- aiofiles: For asynchronous file I/O operations
- Pillow (PIL): For image processing tasks
- tqdm: For progress bars (optional, but useful for visual feedback)
